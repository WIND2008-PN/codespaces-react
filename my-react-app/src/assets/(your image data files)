The directory for image data files is typically used to store images that will be utilized in the application. Since you requested to create a new page for storing image data, I will provide a placeholder for the image data files in the specified directory. 

Here are the contents for the file: /my-react-app/my-react-app/src/assets/(your image data files)

This directory is intentionally left blank.
